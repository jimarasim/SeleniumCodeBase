BROWN PAPER TICKETS AUTOMATED TEST FRAMEWORK

RUNNING THE TESTS:
REPOSITORY: https://github.com/jaemzware/SeleniumCodeBase
BRANCH: BPT
RUN TESTS: mvn clean install -Dnogrid

GOALS:
RUN WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT EXECUTOR - MAKE ELEMENTS WITH IDS THAT DONT OBSCURE OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE UI. E.G.
<TD ONCLICK="JAVASCRIPT"><A HREF="SOMELINK"></A</TD>

TEST CLASS STRUCTURE:
RULE: PAGE  CLASS FOR EVERY PAGE: BasePage
RULE: TEST  CLASS FOR EVERY PAGE: BaseTest

RULE: PAGE  CLASSES ALL DERIVE FROM BasePage
RULE: TEST  CLASSES ALL DERIVE FROM BaseTest
RULE: THERE IS ONE ASSOCIATIVE BASE TEST CLASS FOR EVERY PAGE OBJECT CLASS: BaseEventPage => BaseEventPageTest

RULE: ROOT DERIVATIVE TEST CLASS FOR AN ASSOCIATED PAGE CLASS MUST DECLARE A PAGE OBJECT REFERENCE TO THE ASSOCIATIVE PAGE CLASS FOR ALL OF ITS DESCENDANTS TO USE: e.g. testEventPage (see test below)

public class BPTEventPageTest extends BaseTest {

    BPTEventPage testEventPage = new BPTEventPage();

    @Test
    public void BPTEventPageElementVerificationTest(){
        try{
            ElementVerificationTest(testEventPage.getBasePageUrl(),testEventPage.getBasePageSanityCheckElements());
        }
        catch(Exception ex){
            Assert.fail("FAIL:"+ex.getMessage());
        }
    }
}


RULE: NON-DIRECT BASE TEST CLASS CHILDREN MUST DERIVE FROM A TEST CLASS DERIVED FROM BASE TEST
BPTFindAnEventPage
BPTFindAnEventPageTest - includes page object for BPTFindanEventPage, extends BaseTest
BPTFindAnEventPageSelectEventTest - extends BPTFindAnEventPageTest


NOMENCLATURE:
RULE: BASE TEST FOR A PAGE CLASS IS THE SAME NAME AS THE PAGE CLASS WITH "Test" APPENDED
RULE: TEST CLASS NAMES BEGIN WITH "BPT" AND END WITH "Test", WITH WHAT'S BETWEEN DESCRIBING THE PAGE UNDER TEST
RULE: TEST NAMES SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THEIR CLASS WITHOUT THE "Test" TODO:VERIFY THIS RULE IN CURRENT LATEST DEVELOP BRANCH FRAMEWORK
RULE: TEST PAGE OBJECTS BEGIN WITH "test" FOLLOWED BY THE PAGE CLASS NAME WITHOUT THE BPT PREFIX
RULE: IF YOU DERIVE FROM A TEST CLASS THAT IS NOT A BASE CLASS, USE ITS HAPPY PATH TEST IF FEASIBLE (not too time consuming)
    @Test
    public void BPTVisitFirstPageOfEventsHappyPathTest(){

        super.BPTFindAnEventPageElementVerificationTest();

        try{

            //navigate to the FindAnEvent page
RULE: WEB ELEMENT MEMBER VARIABLES BEGIN WITH web
RULE: BY ELEMENT MEMBER VARIABLES BEGIN WITH by
